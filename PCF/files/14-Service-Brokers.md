## Service Brokers

- What is a service broker?

  > A component of the service which implements the service broker API. This component advertise a catalog of service offerings and service plans, as well as interpreting calls for provision (create), bind, unbind, and deprovision (delete).

- Why do we need service brokers?
  > To make the service available in marketplace for the apps running in CloudFoundry.
  
- How do a service broker and the Cloud Controller intercooperate?
  > The basic auth username and password which are provided when adding a broker are encrypted in Cloud Controller database, and used by the Cloud Controller to authenticate with the broker when making all API calls.
  
- What is the purpose of each broker endpoint?
  > * Catalog Endpoint - makes the plans in the service available for users.
  > * Auth Endpoint - enables Cloud Controller to authenticate the service broker with Username and password.
  
- In general terms, how would you write your own service broker? How would you test it? How would you deploy it for everyone else to use?
  > * Create a service broker.
  > * Register the service broker.
  > * Make the plans publicly available in the catalog.


### pluralsight recap

- Where does a service broker have to be deployed?

> It just needs to be deployed somewhere that the cloud controller can reach it via an HTTPS call. It can live inside PCF as an application or outside of it

- Why provide unique credentials per binding?

> It's the recommended best pratice so that unbinding doesn't affect other applications other than the application being unbound

- Can service broker support an upgrade or downgrade of a service?

> Upgrade support

- The broker is required by the cloud controller to respond within how many seconds?

> 60 seconds

- Does provisioning have to be done synchronously?

> No, it can be done asynchronously if you have a really long provisioning times. There's another endpoint to be implemented.

- Do all services have to be bindable?

> No, they don't
