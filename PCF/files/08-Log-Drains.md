## Log Drains

- What is a log drain?

  > Inorder to persist more than limited amount of logging information that cloud foundry can buffer, logs can be collected into an external Log Management Service.

- How do you create one?

  > External Log Management Services are readily available in the marketplace. `$ cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE` & `$ cf bind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-LOG-STORE`

- Why would you use it?
  > Logs are important to analyze the health & performance of an application. Constant monitoring is required on the application when it is in production. Inorder to address this, we should persist the logs.

- What is "Syslog"?

  > de facto standard for logging on Unix/Linux

### pluralsight recap

Is cf restart or restage required for log draining to start working? Why or why not?

> It's not required, because from application perspective it's just writing to standard out or standard error. Doppler is a component of the Loggregator system that's responsible for forwarding those logs to third party log management services like Paper Trail or Splunk.

How does this approach differ from how you get your logs today?

What kind of alerts or visualizations could you create from your log data?
